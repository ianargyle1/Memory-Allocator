This code impliments the requirements from assignment 5 of CS 4400 (Computer Systems) of the University of Utah. The purpose of this assignment is to write a dynamic storage allocator for C programs; i.e., a custom version of the malloc and free functions.

- mm.{c,h} - My solution malloc package.
- mdriver.c	- The malloc driver that tests your mm.c.
- short{1,2} - bal.rep - Two tiny tracefiles.
